## Cinema Seat Booking System Project

## 📖 Overview
The **Cinema Seat Booking System** is a simple and interactive C++ console application designed to simulate a basic movie ticket booking process.  
It allows users to view available seats, book tickets, and cancel reservations.  
This project is great for learning and demonstrating core C++ programming concepts such as loops, arrays, conditionals, and functions.

## 🚀 Features
✅ View Seat Layout – Displays the current seat arrangement (available/booked).  
✅ Book Seats – Users can book one or multiple seats at a time.  
✅ Cancel Bookings – Allows cancellation of previously booked seats.  
✅ Count Seats – Shows the number of booked and available seats.  
✅ Menu-Based Interface – Simple and user-friendly navigation using a numbered menu.  
✅ Data Storage (Optional) – Extendable with file handling to save and load booking data.
